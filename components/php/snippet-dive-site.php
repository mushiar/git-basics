				<p>Goa – the smallest and richest state in India–has long been a popular tourist destination, but scuba diving is also an increasing draw. Diving off Goa offers some of the easiest access to the Arabian Sea along the Indian mainland and offers lush coral gardens, pinnacles, and a variety of shipwrecks.If you believed entertainment in Goa was limited just to its beaches, alcohol and amazing cuisine, then you’re certainly missing out something special – scuba diving. We’re sure you weren’t aware of this one.Grand Island - Situated around 20kms away from Candolim beach by boat, the under-water visibility at Goa is quite phenomenal even at the deepest points giving you a crystal clear view of the small fish, tinted corals, beautiful shells and other exotic forms of marine life. Top up the experience by enjoying some sumptuous Goan sea food and a beer once through with your dive session!</p>

			</div>
			<div class="media-body">
				<p>Lakshadweep is a remote archipelago starting 200 kilometres/125 miles off India's southwestern coast just above the Maldives. As you can imagine, you'll see a lot of the same lush reefs, overhangs, swim-throughs and big fish action as the Maldives. The only catch? It's currently closed to diving. Check with the local PADI Dive Centers as they're hoping to open it up again soon. About 240 kms off the Malabar coast, this cluster of 36 islands blessed with crystal clear water & white coral sand is a natural paradise for scuba diving. Tourists are left mesmerized by the natural coral reefs, blue lagoons and exquisite marine life. You can actually feel the calmness as soon as you step into the water. The sight of the bright orange fish swimming around like they’re in no rush whatsoever in getting to their destination actually makes the big turtle look a lot faster. However, the moment you stretch out your hands to catch them, you’ll realize how quick they actually are.</p>

			<div class="media-body">
				<p>Just across the eponymous sea from Thailand is the Andaman archipelago, which boasts some of India's best diving. Huge schools of fish, lush coral reefs and pristine conditions make this a must-dive destination. One note for savvy travelers: Although it's part of India, you'll need to show your passport and complete paperwork on arrival. Plus, the time you can spend here might differ from that on your original visa for India. Made up of 572 small islands, Andaman’s beautiful turquoise water, unspoiled beaches & the sight and sound of colorful chirping birds makes for a perfect set up! Head over to Havelock island to enjoy a scuba diving experience of a lifetime. Havelock’s pearl white beaches, coral reefs, dense forests and palm trees will make you want to stay in the water for hours at a stretch. With Dolphins, Turtles and fish, it’s not too hard to imagine why. Those interested in learning deep sea diving, can do so by enrolling in one of the dive schools present in the vicinity.</p>

			<h3 class="media-heading">Island of Netrani</h3>
			<div class="pull-left">
				<img class="media-object img-thumbnail" src="images/dive-5.jpg" alt="Island of Netrani">
			</div>
			<div class="media-body">
				<p>Located off the coast of Karnataka, the coral island of Netrani is suitable for snorkeling as well as for other diving activities. Clear waters blessed with a wealth of marine life such as varieties of coral, butterfly fish, trigger fish, parrot fish, eels and shrimps make for a unique dive experience. On most occasions, diving takes place from a boat which is anchored close to the island. The best time to visit Netrani is between December and January & prior permission is a must to ensure a smooth dive as the island adjacent to Netrani is used by the Indian navy for target practice. That’s it from us. We hope you have a wonderful dive experience. Feel free to share your views with us in the comments below as we love hearing from our visitors.</p>
